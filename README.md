## Fall 2022 - Java


### PURPOSE:
Through 5 weeks of learning Java, you will now get the chance to put what you've learned to the test. This midterm will 
be difficult, and it will push you to learn some new things, as well. You will come out a better, more experienced
programmer, and you will be ready to learn Selenium. Enjoy the process!

##### INSTRUCTIONS:
- Deadline: October 16th @ 10AM
- Clone the project locally
- Copy the `lib` folder that can be found in this project, to a location on your local machine that you can easily access.
Then, add all required dependencies to the project classpath (same as how I showed you in class with Apache/MySQL jars)
- Create your own public repository in GitHub and name it: "<StudentID_FirstName> Java Midterm"
- Once you create your GitHub repo, [click here to add your repo URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G4MIoVKm72f0rt6OHWfEvDvpqn1pMiSrtGB_40LgheE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Point your local repo to your newly created remote repository and verify it is pointing to the correct repo 
`git remote -v` 
  - If not, change which remote repo your local is pointing to by using the following command: 
`git remote set-url <existing remote name> <new repo URL>`
- You must be pushing code to the repo on a consistent basis
  - Best practice (in real life), is to push your code every time you solve a problem, make a change, or finish a task.
  You should have 40+ commits in your repo history


### IMPORTANT NOTES :
- ***DO NOT PUSH ANY CODE CONTAINING ANY KIND OF ERRORS***
- Must complete all coding problems.
- Read the questions thoroughly and understand what is being asked of you. There are files in the project that are there for you to review. 
  - Try to understand how everything is working.
- Google should be used to learn, however, don't just copy and paste answers. You only hurt yourself if you copy and don't try
to understand the solution for yourself. 
- Once submissions are in, we will be reviewing the midterm in class together on the due date. So please be prepared to 
present your solutions.


#### ***ENJOY THE PROCESS & GOOD LUCK!***
